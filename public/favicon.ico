# Favicon Placeholder

A custom favicon should be created and placed here. The favicon should represent the PublicAdis brand, likely using a "P" logo in the amber/orange brand color on a white background.

Recommended specifications:
- 32x32 pixels
- .ico format
- Brand colors (amber/orange)

This file should be replaced with an actual favicon.ico file.
